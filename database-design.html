            <h1> Database Schema</h1>

            <p>
                We have five unique tables for our Settlers of Carolina game.
                All tables, of course, contain an ID column.
                The first one, the Players table, contains four unique
                columns, Username, RoadsCount, SoldiersCount, and Points.
                The second table, called Roads, contains PlayerID and another column called Available.
                The third table, called Tiles, contains only a column named Robber.
                The fourth table, called Colleges, contains PlayerID, Available,
                and University. The last table, called Cards, contains Ram,
                Ramen, Brick, Basketball, Book, Knight, OldWell, ThePit,
                DavisLibrary, Sitterson, BellTower, Roads, Volunteer, Monopoly.
            </p>

            <h2> Players Table</h2>
            <p>
                The Username column holds the username specified by the user
                at the beginning of the game. RoadsCount keeps track of the
                number of roads built by a player and SoldiersCount keeps
                track of the number of Knight development cards played by a
                user. These are important because there is a longest road
                development card and largest army development card which give
                two victory points to the person with the longest road or
                played the most knights, respectively. Points keeps track of the
                number of the victory points the player has and the player that
                reaches ten victory points first wins.
            </p>

            <h2> Roads Table</h2>
            <p>
                The PlayerID column is a foreign key to the Players table.
                The Available column is used to check whether the road is
                available because you can't build a road next to a settlement
                you don't own.
            </p>

            <h2> Tiles Table </h2>
            <p>
                Robber just keeps track of which tile the robber is on.
            </p>

            <h2> Colleges Table</h2>
            <p>
                The PlayerID is a foreign key that points to the Players table.
                Available column is used to check whether the college is available
                because you can't build a college if there is no space for it.
                University keeps tracks of the universities.
            </p>

            <h2> Cards Table</h2>
            <p>
                The Cards Table keeps track of the cards a given player has.
                The specific cards mentioned are the possible cards the player
                has.
            </p>

            <h1> Server-Side API</h1>

            <h2>ORM Layer</h2>
            <p>
                Our project includes an ORM file that contains a couple of classes
                to account for the various tables from the database. In particular,
                these classes are: Card, College, Road, Tile, and Players. The
                Database Schema to the left explains the specific function of
                each class, since the classes themselves are a reference to the
                tables in our database.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ORM classes contain object-oriented functions and instance
                variables, including private and static functions. For instance,
                they provide private variables that hold the values of all
                columns from the SQL tables. Two specific functions, create()
                and connect(), have special uses. The first one, create(), is
                used to create an instance of the class. The connect() function
                is used to make a connection to the SQL database and returns a
                reference to the mysqli object. Another function, called
                getJSON(), returns a json encoded representation of the class.
                This function is important because it is the basis for server-client
                AJAX communication.
            </p>

            <h2> HTTP and AJAX</h2>
            <p>
                For our project, we are implementing GET and POST. The GET
                request is used to obtain a specific value from a particular table
                in the SQL database. The POST request is used to create/update
                information on a table. The GET/POST parameters vary by ORM class, so
                we will have to list them by class.
            </p>
