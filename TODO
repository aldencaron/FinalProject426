1.  add to PHP: (SUPER IMPORTANT THINGS TO FOCUS ON)
    We need a function from the Roads Database, that returns "all of it."  aka it needs to return
      all the columns and roads in an array. (we can specify by using a special request parameter called "getAll" or something).
        Similarly, for Players, Cards, Colleges.
2.    Add to the setup.php: when creating the table for DiceRolls, go ahead and populate 1000 rows with pregenerated dice rolls, which
        are randomint[1,6] + randomint[1,6] for the two rolls (and not randomint[1,12]). We'll index in by ID which corresponds to the
          turn number.
3.    Add to DevCards Database (Shelly): a column named "Index" that is type (int(11)) to keep track of which dev card we are actually using.
4.
