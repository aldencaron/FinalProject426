1.  add to PHP: (SUPER IMPORTANT THINGS TO FOCUS ON)
    We need a function from the Roads Database, that returns "all of it."  aka it needs to return
      all the columns and roads in an array. (we can specify by using a special request parameter called "getAll" or something).
        Similarly, for Players, Cards, Colleges.
2.    Add to DevCards Database (Shelly): a column named "Index" that is type (int(11)) to keep track of which dev card we are actually using.
